Name of file contains information on band (Y,J,H,K,L,M), angle of echelle
grating and order.

Each file contains information on the position on the detector (X,Y, 
both in mm) of the image of the top/bottom points of the slit at
a given wavelength.
The slit image can be accurately approximated by a straight line connecting 
the top/bottom points.
Note that the echelle disperses in the Y direction.

The information are printed sequentially. 
Below is a "block" of data referring to a given wavelength.
The "block" is repeated n-times in each file, to cover all the 
wavelengths used to sample a given order.
Positions at intermediate wavelenghts can be determined by interpolation.
