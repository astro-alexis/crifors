SGC_template.npz is a numpy .npz
that can be used as
t=np.load('SGC_template.npz')
Then t['wave'] is wavelengths in nm
and t['spec'] the non-normalized
spectrum.

Origin: Ulf Seeman's measurments
with the GÃ¶ttingen FTS.
Separate spectra fro H and K-band
were concatenated and wavenumbers
in 1/cm converted by 1E7/[WN].
